# Cyber_Homelab
A detection and monitoring Cybersecurity home lab.

As a Systems and Security student, one of my goals is to further my skills to land a Cybersecurity role someday. Being able to protect your client can save your data from being exposed or even losing millions of dollars. 

So, I want to perform an at-home cybersecurity lab to gain actual hands-on experience and test my threat-hunting skills. The objective is to set up a virtual lab to perform detection & monitoring alerts.

Iâ€™ll create a VirtualBox machine for my testing environment, and I will use a Ubuntu OS for this. For my detection alerts, I will use Splunk to retrieve data and review logs. 

The objective is to set up a lab to perform detection & monitoring alerts. Watching for these alerts can prevent an organization from any potential cyber-attacks.
